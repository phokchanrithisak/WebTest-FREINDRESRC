# WebTest
**KEEN Template** to automate Web Application **_Test_** with [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/), [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/), [Junit Test](http://junit.org/junit4/) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

It **handles** almost all the headache in starting new automated testing project with `java` as the client library.
**You just have to start coding, then *run* your _test framework_ from either _Intellij IDEA_ or _command prompt_ or 
_terminal_**.

## Documentation

### Prerequisite
This WebTest template use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework with [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) to get the advantages of `.feature` files.
- If you are not familiar with Gherkin, please refer <https://cucumber.io/docs/reference> for language concepts and its syntax.
- IDE requirement is [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/); either the Ultimate or the Community one would be fine.
